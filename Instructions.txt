HOW TO USE YUGIOH PDF EXPORTER
==============================

== PRE-SETUP NOTES ==
This tool is designed to take a series of Yugioh Card images and place them onto an A3-sized PDF document.

The system may trigger some anti-virus software, due to scanning text files and images. The program is hard-coded to find specific files based on the contents of ImportList.txt.
This consists of the numeric IDs of images from ygoprodeck.com,  and the .txt file with the same name as the folder. It will not scan anything else.

You will need .NET 7.0 installed for this to run. Visit https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0. Simply download the installer for your machine (i.e. for Windows 10, Win x64 installer).

1) == SETUP == 
	a) Visit https://ygoprodeck.com/deck-search/, and search for a deck you like. Optionally import an existing deck from elsewhere.
	b) Create a folder on your PC with a suitable name, such as 'Yugi'
	c) Create a new .txt file inside your folder, with the same name. In our example, this would be Yugi\\Yugi.txt

2) == DOWNLOAD REFERENCES ==
	a) On your ygoprodeck.com deck view, click the 'More...' dropdown, and 'Download All Images'.
	b) Extract all images from the download and place inside your created folder, such as "Yugi\\38033121.jpg"
	c) In the same dropdown on the deck view, click 'Export Deck', and copy the 'Export to Tabletop Simulator' text.
	d) Paste this text inside of the text file you created.
	
3) == CONFIGURATION ==  
	a) Open your folder containing your images and .txt file, and copy the file path (Click the navigation bar at the top, and copy the text there).
	b) Open "ImportList.txt" in the same folder as these instructions, and clear all text in the file.
	c) Paste the copied file path onto a single line, then save the file.
		- If you wish to process multiple decks at once, please ensure each file path is on separate lines.
		
4) == RUNNING THE APP ==
	a) Double-click the 'Yu-Gi-Oh_Deck-to-PDF.exe' application and let the process run.
	b) Navigate to the 'Output-Decks' folder, which will be created beside the .exe.
	c) View the PDF file(s) created to ensure all cards are included.
	d) Print your PDF on a printer in A3 size
	
Congratulations, you now have a free deck printed! You can optionally attach an A3 card to the back of your prints for added structural stability.
Happy Dueling!
